            <li>Do not click on any links or attachments in the email. These may contain malware or direct you to a phishing website. Hovering over a link with your cursor can reveal the actual link destination.</li>
            <li>Verify the sender's email address. Check the sender's email address to see if it matches the expected email address of the company or organization. Phishing emails may use fake or similar-looking email addresses to trick you.</li>
            <li>Check for spelling and grammar errors. Legitimate emails from professional organizations typically have correct spelling and grammar.</li>
            <li>Look for urgency or threats. Phishing emails often try to create a sense of urgency or fear to encourage you to act quickly without thinking.</li>
            <li>Report the email. If you suspect an email is a phishing attempt, forward the email to your IT department or report it using the company's established reporting procedures.</li>
            <li>Delete the email. Once you've reported the email, delete it from your inbox to avoid accidentally clicking on any links or attachments.</li>
